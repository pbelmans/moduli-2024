  title: On proper splinters in positive characteristic
  speaker: krah
  abstract: >
    <p>A scheme $X$ is a splinter if for any finite surjective morphism $f\colon Y \to X$ the pullback map $\mathcal{O}_X \to f_* \mathcal{O}_Y$ splits as $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. By the direct summand conjecture, now a theorem due to AndrÃ©, every regular Noetherian ring is a splinter. Whilst for affine schemes the splinter property can be viewed as a local measure of singularity, the splinter property imposes strong constraints on the global geometry of proper schemes over a field of positive characteristic. For instance, the structure sheaf of a proper splinter in positive characteristic has vanishing positive-degree cohomology. I will report on joint work with Charles Vial concerning further obstructions on the global geometry of proper splinters in positive characteristic. Further, I will address the derived-invariance of the (derived-)splinter property.

    <p>Kronecker moduli are algebraic varieties parametrizing linear algebra data up to base change. We consider generating series of their motives, and discuss results characterizing these series by functional and differential equations.

  title: The motive of the Hilbert scheme of points in all dimensions
  speaker: ricolfi
  abstract: >
    <p>The geometry of Hilbert schemes of points is largely unknown, or known to be pathological in a precise sense. This should in principle make most Hilbert scheme invariants essentially inaccessible. We present a closed formula for the generating function of the motives (classes in the Grothendieck ring of varieties) of Hilbert schemes of points $\mathrm{Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^n,d)$, varying the ambient dimension $n$ and having fixed the number of points $d$. Joint work with M. Graffeo, S. Monavari and R. Moschetti.

  title: Hall algebras of Higgs bundles on a curve
  speaker: padurariu
  abstract: >
    <p>I will report on joint work with Yukinobu Toda (partially in progress) about the (categorical) Hall algebra of Higgs bundles on a curve. These categories have semiorthogonal decompositions in certain categories, called quasi-BPS, whose construction is inspired by the enumerative geometry of Calabi-Yau threefolds.
    <p>I will focus on two conjectural dualitities. The first is between the Hall algebra of semistable Higgs bundles of degree zero and a "limit" category. This equivalence aims to make precise the proposal of Donagi-Pantev of considering the classical limit of the de Rham Langlands equivalence. The second is a primitive (or BPS) version of the first, and it relates categories of sheaves on moduli of semistable Higgs bundles (for various degrees). This equivalence may be regarded as a version of the D-equivalence conjecture / SYZ mirror symmetry. We can prove (partial) versions of these conjectures for topological K-theory of these categories.
